    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <p>
        In my personal life I keep to only a couple of primary hobbies. At current they include
        <ul>
            <li>3D Printing</li>
                I am re-learning industrial design and producing my own parts for at-home use. Presently I own 
                3 separate printers. 
                <ul>
                    <li>Sunlu S8</li>
                    <li>FlashForge Adventurer 3</li>
                    <li>SOVOL SV06</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Video Games</li>
                <p>Primarily I play Massive Multiplayer Online games. Until recently I ran a competitive group for over 
                    4 years. When new content was released we would push to complete it before guides or strategies
                    were released to the public. This led to our group requiring people at not just a high skill level
                    but also with the ability to take in new information and process that into strategies to complete
                    the newest content.</p>
                <p>As the group leader I did all of our recruiting, interviewing, initial vetting of prospective
                    members, and devising novel strategies to test applicants in unknown environments. This came down 
                    to ensuring new members fit our group atmosphere, could perform at the level we required, and 
                    could contribute in developing strategies.
                </p>
                <p>For my own personal benchmarks I aimed to be within the top 200 in the world on my class for the
                    entire content release. Each content release contained 5 individual fights with their own rankings.
                    Holding this average ranking meant I had to consistently perform at an incredibly high level across all
                    5 fights. Several times achieving top 20, top 10, and top 5 rankings. This required keeping up with 
                    balance changes on the class, bleeding edge strategies for the fights, and creating new methods to 
                    use for my class and team in every encounter.</p>
        </ul>
    </p>
